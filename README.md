This study explores the intricate relationships between music preferences, mental health, and social media sentiments by analyzing data from 4,300 individuals
diagnosed with mental disorders (e.g., Depression, Anxiety, PTSD). Using two datasets with around 5 million tweets and over 220,000 songs, the research investigates
whether mental disorders influence musical tastes and if these preferences are reflected in social media sentiment. Methods included text preprocessing, 
network analysis, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and logistic regression, utilizing Python and R. Results reveal a diverse network of music preferences, with some
widely shared artists and a high presence of niche tastes. Topic modeling highlighted emotional and thematic diversity in both tweets and songs, emphasizing topics 
like frustration, emotions, and entertainment. Sentiment analysis revealed that users generally express more positive emotions on Twitter, despite preferring songs with negative sentiments. 
Logistic regression demonstrated an inverse relationship between mood and song sentiment: individuals with negative moods have a higher probability 
of listening to positive songs and vice versa. Interestingly, no significant variation in this relationship was observed across different mental
disorders, except for PTSD, which influenced overall song preferences.
